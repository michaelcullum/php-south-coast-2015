bio: |
  Many moons ago, at the tender age of 14, Cal touched his first computer. (We’re using the term “computer” loosely here, it was a TRS-80 Model 1) Since then his life has never been the same. He graduated from TRS-80s to Commodores and eventually to IBM PC’s. For the past 13 years Cal has worked with PHP and MySQL on Linux, OSX, and Windows. He has built a variety of projects ranging in size from simple web pages to multi-million dollar web applications. When not banging his head on his monitor, attempting a blood sacrifice to get a particular piece of code working, he enjoys building and managing development teams using his widely imitated but never patented management style of “management by wandering around”. These days, when not working with PHP, Cal can be found working on a variety of projects like CoderFaire. He speaks at conferences around the world on topics ranging from technical talks to motivational talks for developers. If you happen to meet him at a conference, don’t be afraid to buy him a shot of Bourbon. Cal is based in Nashville TN where he is happily married to wife 1.30, the lovely and talented Kathy. Together they have 2 wonderful kids who were both smart enough not to pursue a job in IT.

talk_abstract: |
  What makes a developer a "professional developer"? Getting paid? Getting quoted? Publishing a book? Let's take a look at this.

  This talk will look at the traits that define a professional developer. Not the hard tech skills, those change with the tools being used. These are the soft and quasi-soft skills that developers have to master to be considered a professional developer.

  Along the way there will be some tweetable moments, and of course, a long line of bad jokes. Hopefully though, you will take away a concept that you need to work on to round out your skills and unlock your "Going Pro" badge.
